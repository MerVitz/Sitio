        <h2>EARLY LIFE</h2>
        <p > I am Mercy Achieng, I came into this world in the scenic landscapes of Homa Bay County, Kenya, where the beauty of nature served as the backdrop to my birth.

            My formative years were spent in the charming environs of Busia County, Kenya, where I embarked on my educational journey.
            During my early years in Busia, I dedicated myself to primary education, laying the foundation for my academic journey.

            For my secondary education, I embarked on an enriching academic experience at Archbishop Okoth Ojolla in the captivating surroundings of Kisumu County.
            I am currently immersed in the pursuit of a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Maseno University, where I am diligently honing my skills and knowledge in the dynamic field of computer science.
